# toolbox-geoclip
This is a toolbox programmed in python (arcpy module) for ArcGIS Pro that allows you to clip an Esri Shapefile or an GeoTIFF from a selected mask layer. The toolbox performs the clip and adds the resulting layers to the project. The tool is under development and so far it applies validations regarding the type of input data and output folders.
